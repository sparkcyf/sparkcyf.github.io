      <description>Jetson is an embedded AI computing platform launched by Nvidia. Compared to laptops and servers, Jetson has a smaller size and lower power consumption, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. Oxford Nanopore Technology has also released MinION Mk1C based on the Jetson platform for real-time analysis of sequencing data. This article describes how to install and run Bonito Basecaller on Jetson for real-time sequencing data analysis and model training on edge devices.</description>

      <description>Bonito, named after the bonito fish, is a basecaller developed by Oxford Nanopore Technology. In this article, I will try to explain, in an easy-to-understand way, the data flow and data formats of Bonito, as well as some knowledge needed for the secondary development of Bonito (or even other nanopore sequencing basecallers).</description>
