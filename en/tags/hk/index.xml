&lt;p&gt;The second phase of the Sha Tau Kok Open Plan will commence on January 1, 2024. In the first stage, up to 1,000 visitors per day will be allowed to visit the entire Sha Tau Kok area except Chung Ying Street after applying for a Closed Area Permit online. This will give more people the opportunity to learn about the history, culture, and natural landscape of Sha Tau Kok and nearby outlying islands, and promote cultural and ecological tourism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to activate cross-border roaming service for my classmate&amp;rsquo;s phone, I recently took the time to visit Ma Tso Lung again (the last time was &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.sparktour.me/posts/2019/09/09/trip-to-border-of-sz-and-hk/&#34;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;). Due to the impact of the border closure, compared to August 2019, the number of people going to Ma Tso Lung has significantly increased. The way to get to Ma Tso Lung was slightly different from the last time. This time, I took the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hkbus.fandom.com/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E7%95%8C%E5%B0%88%E7%B6%AB%E5%B0%8F%E5%B7%B451B%E7%B7%9A&#34;&gt;51B minibus&lt;/a&gt; from Sheung Shui, which took only about half an hour compared to the two-hour walk in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
