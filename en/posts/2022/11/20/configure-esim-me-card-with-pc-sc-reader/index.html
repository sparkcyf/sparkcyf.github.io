It’s obviously not cost-effective to purchase these LTE modules just to configure the eSIM card.\nUpdate at Sep 2024: Users with removable eSIMs can consider using MiniLPA, which has more complete functionality than the demonstration-oriented LPAdesktop provided by truephone. Truphone/LPAdesktop After further searching on the Internet, I came across the desktop software Truphone/LPAdesktop, whose manual mentions that it can configure these eSIM cards through a PC/SC smart card reader. And the current smart card readers on the market generally only cost around 30-50 yuan, which is much more affordable than buying an LTE module.\nEnvironment Preparation One PC/SC reader (you can search for smart card reader/PCSC reader/health insurance card reader on Taobao). The reader looks similar to the card writing device in the telecom business hall. Generally, readers that support the PC/SC generic driver are driver-free under Windows and Mac. If you need to connect the reader under Linux, you can refer to this article to configure it. Mainly, you need to install pcscd and add the vendorID and productID of the reader. JRE environment Compilation and Installation Refer to the instructions on Github to compile using docker-compose. It’s important to note that the webcam component in LPADesktop https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/ is not compatible with arm devices. If you need to run it on arm devices, you can consider commenting out the components related to webcam (I have modified a version without the webcam component, which can be downloaded at https://github.com/sparkcyf/LPAdesktop/releases/)\nUsage After installing the JRE, run java -jar LPA-1.0.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar in the directory:\nProgram UI After confirming that the program can recognize the reader, click connect to see the information of the eSIM and the currently installed profiles:\neSIM Card Information Right-click on different profiles to activate/deactivate/delete profiles.\nIf you need to add a new profile, you can click on download in the lower right corner, and then manually enter the profile information:\nAdd Profile If the string obtained by scanning the configuration QR code is similar to 1$prod.smdp-plus.rsp.goog$052X-UFXS-CQIY-PNGL, then fill in the Matching id as 052X-UFXS-CQIY-PNGL and the server url as prod.smdp-plus.rsp.goog.\nOther If you have a relatively new, rooted Android device around, you can also try using PeterCxy/OpenEUICC software to configure it directly on your phone.
