In this two-week trip, I visited cities on the West Coast, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, and on the East Coast, including New York and Washington, D.C.\nRoute and Attractions Map My general itinerary involved driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, then flying to New York, taking a train to Washington, D.C., and finally flying back to San Francisco.\nPre-Trip Preparations Visa Fill out the DS-160 form, schedule an interview slot, and then go for an interview at the consulate. Slots at the southern consulates are quite tight, so it’s advisable to book about a year in advance of your planned trip. Based on DPs from people around me, graduate students applying for a visa may be asked by the officer to provide a transcript and CV (even if the purpose is tourism), so it’s recommended to prepare these in advance. If you don’t have them, you might be put on hold (check), and you’ll need to send your transcript, CV, and travel plan to the consulate’s email, which takes about a month to process. You’ll then get a one-year visa with CLEARANCE RECEIVED 202X-XX-XX. It’s said that this clearance is valid for 48 months, but I haven’t tried to get another visa yet. The only advantage of a one-year visa compared to a ten-year one is that you don’t need to fill out EVUS again.\nFlights It’s recommended to check Google Flights and other platforms frequently. Generally, it’s advisable to start looking at and buying transoceanic flight tickets about 6 months before your trip, as prices are relatively lower then. However, since I chose to travel in August, which may coincide with many international students returning to school, the prices for direct flights and convenient connecting flights (via Japan and South Korea) all exceeded 10,000 RMB. After considering flight prices and comfort, I chose the route MFM-SIN-SFO and SFO-SIN-HKG, operated by Singapore Airlines, which cost about 7,500 RMB per person after a student discount. But it must be said that this route is much longer than a direct flight. The great-circle distance for the MFM-SIN-SFO one-way journey is as high as 16,117km, a distance that can reach South America. In comparison, the direct HKG-SFO flight is only 11,147km, a difference of 1/3 in distance.\nFor domestic flights within the US, it’s recommended to purchase tickets about 2 months before departure. However, considering that the three major US airlines (UA, DL, AA) allow free changes and refunds for the price difference (as vouchers) on domestic flights, even if you buy a more expensive ticket, you can convert it to a cheaper one through a refund as a voucher.\nCar Rental Considering that this was my first time driving overseas, we booked a car on the website 租租车 (Zuzuche) for our self-drive trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles. (In theory, large OTAs like Zuzuche and Ctrip should work, as they can get travel agency rates. The only requirement is that the renter needs to present a mainland China driver’s license.) The car rental company we were assigned was Avis. Renting a Compact car for 7 days cost about 495 USD. The actual car we got was a 2020 Hyundai Elantra Limited, which had features like ACC, lane keeping, and CarPlay. Aside from the average noise control, I was quite satisfied with it.\n2020 Hyundai Elantra Limited Both mainland China and North America use left-hand drive and right-hand traffic. The main differences are that in North America, you need to completely stop for about 3 seconds at a STOP sign before proceeding, and when turning right at a red light, you also need to stop completely before turning. Another detail I noticed is that when waiting at a red light in North America, don’t get too close to the car in front of you. If you follow the habit of mainland China, Americans might think you’re going to rear-end them, and they might even move forward a bit if you’re too close. Attractions/Experience Ticket Bookings Museums in the United States are not as competitive as those in Europe and other places. Generally, booking two or three days in advance or even buying tickets on-site is fine. The only tickets that were sold out on-site were the ferry tickets to Alcatraz Island in San Francisco.\nI personally recommend using the website “美旅通” for planning, especially when specifying the itinerary for visiting major attractions. I think it works very well. Compared to Xiaohongshu and some “travel blogs”, its information density is high, and it has basically no ads (I feel its main source of revenue is from accommodation affiliate links). Payment Methods/Tipping If you don’t want to rely on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu when choosing a restaurant, you can consider directly filtering restaurants on Google Maps with ratings higher than 4.3. Generally, restaurants above this line have some unique features and are not likely to be bad. Of course, if you’re still too lazy to choose, you can consider eating at common chain fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Taco Bell, etc. Most places support credit card payments. We only encountered one small pizza place that didn’t accept credit cards. Considering the tipping culture in North America (though I don’t like it), it’s recommended to have a few tens of 1 USD bills for tipping hotel shuttle drivers and housekeeping (if you don’t have them, it’s okay not to tip. I exchanged some at the hotel front desk on the first day).\nScenario Is Tipping Recommended? How Much to Tip How to Tip Handling luggage, valet parking If no price is listed, yes 1 USD per bag, valet parking depends on the situation Cash Housekeeping If staying more than 1 night, yes 2-5 USD per night Cash, placed under the pillow Restaurant (with waiter service) Generally yes If writing the tip amount, I usually give 10-15% of the pre-tax amount and round it up. Calculated when paying by card Restaurant (counter service) Optional If the server doesn’t bring the food and I pick it up myself, I usually don’t tip. If the server brings the food, then I give 10% Calculated when paying by card. Some POS machines have default options like 15%, 18%, 20%. You can ignore them and enter your own custom amount. Phone/Data Card If you have a phone that supports eSIM, you can try the 15-day trial with Visible or Verizon. Or you can buy a phone card on Fliggy (飞猪). A 15-day card costs around 120-150 CNY. It’s important to note that if you’re driving in more remote areas, most carriers might not have signal (like in the middle of Highway 1). If necessary, you can download offline maps. Also, hotspotting on American phone cards will be speed-limited (about 5Mbps). If you need higher speeds, it’s better for everyone to have their own card.\nClimate The weather on both the East and West Coasts in August isn’t too cold, with temperatures ranging between 15-30 degrees Celsius. The coldest times (San Francisco mornings, New York) require a sweater and a jacket, while the hottest times (Los Angeles) are fine with a t-shirt and shorts.\nDay 0: Arrival in San Francisco Sunset seen from the Macau-Singapore leg, very vibrant Sunrise on the plane, this should be near Alaska Considering the need to pick up our rental car on the third day and the price of accommodation in the city center, we chose to stay at the Aloft SFO hotel in the Millbrae area near the airport. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to and from the airport, about every half hour, and it takes 10 minutes on the shuttle. The Millbrae station of the Caltrain and BART is also close to the hotel, about a 10-minute walk away.\nSan Francisco Airport International Terminal, you can wait here for the free shuttle to the hotel After dropping off our luggage, a local friend took me around the city, briefly visiting areas near Union Square and Chinatown.\nView of I80 heading into the city and part of the San Francisco skyline A street scene near Chinatown A “hollowed-out” city center, with many shops vacant and “For Lease” signs posted Area near Union Square, with a Waymo RoboTaxi and the Apple Store in the distance Road near Millbrae, looks new, probably recently built Day 1: San Francisco City Map from “美旅通” Considering San Francisco’s safety issues (especially car break-ins), we didn’t try to drive in the city center. Instead, we mainly relied on public transportation like BART, trams, and buses.\nIn the morning, I took the BART into the city. You can use Clipper to ride BART, which can be opened on an iPhone (no opening fee). It must be said that the fare evasion issue on BART is serious. Both when entering and exiting the station, I saw more than one person jumping over the ticket barriers, and the staff didn’t seem to care much.\nBART interior, a special feature is that BART is a wide-gauge train, so the interior looks a bit wider than regular subways After getting to Union Square, we walked to the Painted Ladies and then to Japantown, where we had lunch.\nPainted Ladies and city skyline Peace Pagoda in Japantown Ramen in Japantown (HINODEYA Ramen Japantown) After lunch, we experienced Waymo’s self-driving car. Similar to Pony.ai, which I experienced in Guangzhou, Waymo also uses an app to select the starting point and destination, and then you can wait for the car at the designated location. Compared to Pony.ai, Waymo’s cars seem to drive more aggressively (which might also be because Waymo uses electric cars), even trying to cut into the right-turn traffic flow. We rode for 2.4 miles (4km), which cost 24 USD, quite expensive compared to Uber (about twice the price of a standard Uber).\nWaymo After taking a ride to the seaside, I experienced the cable cars. The experience was similar to the trams in Hong Kong, but unfortunately, there were too many people, and I couldn’t experience standing on the sides of the car.\nCable car reversing After that, we walked to Fisherman’s Wharf. We originally wanted to take a ferry to Alcatraz Island, but since the Alcatraz ferry tickets were sold out when we tried to buy them three days in advance, we settled for a sightseeing boat tour to see the Golden Gate Bridge instead (there were plenty of seats on the sightseeing boat, and you could buy tickets at the ticket office at any time).\nSightseeing boat One of the Golden Gate Bridge piers seen from the boat Full view of the Golden Gate Bridge Alcatraz Island and the San Francisco city center In the evening, with the goal of trying all of San Francisco’s public transportation, we took the bus to the San Francisco Caltrain station and took the train back to Millbrae. Compared to BART, Caltrain is a more serious commuter rail (but you can use Clipper). The staff checking tickets only allowed people to go to the platform 10 minutes before departure, a bit like CR (China Railway). The Caltrain we rode was still the Gallery Car from before the electrification (right side of the picture below), which seems to be at least 40 years old. The structure of the car is very unique; the middle of the second floor is hollow and connected to the first floor.\nNew and old Caltrain, the old Caltrain will be completely retired in 2024 Returning to the hotel from Millbrae station, you need to pass the entrance ramp of US101 Day 2: San Jose Overpass of AirTrain and BART This morning, I took the hotel shuttle back to the airport again and then took the airport AirTrain to the rental car parking lot to pick up the car. The self-driving trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles officially started on this day. According to the car’s odometer, we drove 745mi (1198km) in six and a half days.\nSince we had already prepaid for the car rental online, we only needed to show our driver’s license and sign the contract at the counter. After the counter froze the 250 USD deposit on the card, they told us the location of the car in the parking lot, and we could directly go upstairs to pick up the car. The only thing to note is that the staff at the counter might ask if you want to add some insurance, refueling service, and ETC. If you don’t need them, you need to explicitly reject them. I rented a Compact (Corolla or similar) and got a 2020 Hyundai Elantra Limited, which had features like a digital dashboard, ACC, lane keeping, and CarPlay.\nStanford University After driving out of the airport, we first went to Stanford University. If you need to park, consider parking spots around Stanford Oval. If you want to eat nearby, you can also park in the parking lot next to the Stanford Shopping Center, and then walk or take the university’s shuttle bus to the campus.\nBricks with graduation year markings Hoover Tower Interestingly, the Stanford campus was the place with the most Chinese tourists on our entire trip, perhaps showing the strong desire for famous universities in East Asia.\nStanford Oval (and parking spots next to it) GooglePlex GooglePlex has a separate visitor center with a store that sells Pixel, Google Cast, and other Google-branded products, and a cafe. Tourists can park at the Shoreline Amphitheatre Parking Lot C. After crossing the street, you’ll reach the new GooglePlex main building. There are many bicycles in the Google campus that seem to be free to ride. We went to the work area on a weekend, and it seemed that no one was working overtime inside, and the lights were off. I wonder if the headquarters needs to set an example for a five-day work week.\nBicycles outside the GooglePlex visitor center Scene inside the Google work area Google’s old office building (1900 Charleston Road) Apple Park Visitor Center Apple’s visitor center is located outside Apple Park, and visitors cannot enter Apple Park itself. However, Apple Park has an AR model where visitors can use an iPad to view the entire Apple Park model (probably to showcase ARKit). The Apple Park visitor center is also an Apple Store, which sells small souvenirs like shirts and cups, unlike regular Apple Stores.\nApple Park model based on AR Kit Sign for the Visitor Center After visiting Apple Park, we drove to the hotel. Interestingly, the hotel was next to the headquarters of Cisco and Cadence, and seemed to be the reception hotel for these two companies. There was even a Wi-Fi network called “Cadence” in the hotel. There was a shopping plaza next to the hotel (shopping plazas in North America are literally squares, with a large parking lot in the middle and some shops around it). There was a Walmart and a McDonald’s, so we had dinner there and bought some water for the car.\nUS101 southbound section, San Jose section Passing by the Cisco headquarters McDonald’s Entrance of Walmart and Sierra Vista in the distance Day 3: Monterey, CA-1, Seaside CA-1 (Highway 1) often has landslides in the summer. During my trip, only the southbound direction was open, while the northbound direction was closed. So, I drove to the Great Sur Vista Point and returned the same way. If you need to check the status of CA-1, you can check the CA DOT website or this link. After having breakfast at McDonald’s in the morning, we first headed southwest on CA-85. After a stretch of mountain road, we reached CA-1. If you go too early, the fog on the road might not have completely dissipated, and visibility might be low. You should drive carefully.\nTruck on the mountain road Vineyard Stratus clouds haven’t dissipated After the fog has cleared Because of the road closure, I only drove to the area near Great Sur Vista Point. The scenery along the way was still very good, especially the very blue sea.\nBixby Bridge Bixby Bridge in the distance Garr Apata State Park Highway along the coast Cars parked on the side of the road (the Elantra we rented is on the far right) After driving back from CA-1, we also took a loop on 17 Mile Drive (a toll road with coastal views). It’s recommended to enter from Pacific Grove Gate when visiting, so that you can drive along the coast when you drive on the right side.\nEntrance Sunset at the sea Old tree by the sea Rocky beach CA-1 at dusk Day 4: US-101, King City, Morro Bay Because CA-1 was not fully open due to landslides, we had to detour back to US-101 and continue south to Morro Bay. We mainly drove on this day and stopped for a short break in King City.\nAfter leaving CA-1, the surrounding scenery turned into a desert style, somewhat similar to the highway in the Hexi Corridor A rest area in King City, with gas stations, KFC, McDonald’s, Starbucks, etc. Continuing on US-101 Back on CA-1 again In the evening, we drove to our accommodation in Morro Bay. Morro Bay is also the prototype for Night City in “Cyberpunk 2077”. In the setting, Morro Bay is called “Tomorrow Bay”.\nMorro Rock Morro Bay pier Morro Bay pier Our dinner at a western restaurant on the Morro Bay pier, Tognazzini’s Dockside Restaurant. We ordered their grilled seafood platter, which was quite large The smokestack of the Morro Bay power plant, now decommissioned Sunset, the photo was taken around Morro Bay Water Access Evening glow in front of the motel Day 5: CA-1, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles Today, we continued driving south, stopping for a while in the town of Solvang, a Danish-style town (somewhat like a “Ancient Town” built in mainland China).\nA scene from Solvang Streets of Solvang Clouds on the highway After driving in, it was foggy Gas station. Gas stations in North America are self-service. Just insert your credit card and lift the pump. Now most gas stations support foreign credit cards with PIN Hills of Southern California Santa Barbara seaside Santa Barbara church On the way back to CA-1 Back on CA-1, there was some traffic due to road work Typical Southern California landscaping, palm trees on the side of the road (and typical California gas prices) Back to two lanes Suburban expressway Pacific Palisades area, already in the suburbs of Los Angeles Pacific Palisades Arriving near Santa Monica Driving into the city on I-10 Day 6: Los Angeles City Tour guide map from 美旅通, you can refer to this map to plan your itinerary K-Town In the morning, we first went to Griffith Observatory. If you go early (before 10 AM), you can consider parking directly on the mountain road. If you go later, you can park at Greek Theater Parking at the foot of the mountain.\nMain building of the Griffith Observatory LA Downtown, a typical “spread out” urban planning In the distance (on the right), it looks like something is on fire At noon, we tried Italian food (pasta) at Maccheroni Republic with friends. Although the presentation wasn’t great, it tasted good A scene in Downtown After that, we drove to the Getty Center, which mainly exhibits classical and contemporary artworks. The classical artworks at the Getty felt like they were mainly from Europe, similar to some artworks seen in European palaces.\nWalt Disney Concert Hall Getty Center (on the mountain to the left) Getty tram I-405 and Los Angeles Downtown Stickers in the North Pavilion In the evening, I went to Santa Monica Pier. I believe many people first learned about this place in the GTA. The layout of the pier in the game is basically the same as the real Santa Monica Pier.\nParking in Santa Monica is competitive and expensive. You can consider parking in one of the Parking Structures one block away. It seems that parking for less than an hour is free.\nSanta Monica Pier in the distance Parking lot on Santa Monica Pier Amusement facilities on the pier Sunset over the Pacific Ocean Day 7: Los Angeles City In the morning, I first went around the Hollywood sign. Because the sign is on a hill, it looks relatively small in photos taken with a phone.\nHollywood Sign At noon, I went for a walk on the USC campus with friends. The USC campus is not large, and the architectural style is quite uniform.\nMy friend took us to Sun Nong Dan in K-Town, which serves Korean-style iron plate beef ribs and beef bone soup. One of the dishes was finished by the staff lighting a fire on the dish to heat it up USC Campus In the evening, I went to the famous In-N-Out Burger near LAX airport. It’s very close to the runway, so you can eat burgers while watching planes.\nLAX In-N-Out Burger Planes seen from LAX In-N-Out Burger BA’s A380 AVIS parking lot LAX sign at the airport entrance To save on accommodation costs, we booked the latest LAX-EWR flight of the day, which was equivalent to resting for 5 hours on the plane and arriving in New York the next morning.\nThe plane was a nearly 30-year-old 777-200, with shorter seat pitch than the 777 used for intercontinental flights and no IFE, but the plane had Wi-Fi Day 8: New York After arriving at EWR, we took the Newark Airport Express bus into the city. You need to buy tickets online in advance or pay the driver cash (22.5 USD). The trip into the city takes about 1 hour (although I was asleep the whole time, so I didn’t notice anything). If there is no traffic, it’s more comfortable than the AirTrain and NJ Transit, which require transfers.\nSince I was too tired on that day, we only went to see the Harry Potter play and then went back to the hotel to rest.\nTime Square Day 9: New York 42 St subway station Downtown Downtown attractions (美旅通) This morning, we first went to the southern part of Manhattan (Downtown).\nSubway station. A strange design of the New York subway is that all exits are labeled with names, not numbers, which makes it a bit inconvenient for tourists to find exits New York’s subway has a flat fare system, and you can use your credit card to enter. Some stations also support virtual transfers.\nExit signs at the subway station Considering the limited time, we didn’t take a boat to see the Statue of Liberty. The distance from Battery Park is relatively far. Also, because Battery Park was under construction, the whole seaside was surrounded by fences, and there were only a limited number of angles to see the statue.\nStatue of Liberty seen from Battery Park After leaving Battery Park, walking north along Broadway will take you past Wall Street, the NYSE, and other locations.\nCharging Bull on Wall Street Trinity Church NYSE Brooklyn Bridge After walking to Fulton St station, you can take the subway one stop to High St, and then walk back to Manhattan Island across the Brooklyn Bridge.\nBrooklyn District Brooklyn Bridge At noon, we had Southeast Asian food at Nemesis Intrepid Sea, Air \u0026 Space Museum In the afternoon, I visited the Intrepid Sea, Air \u0026 Space Museum (USS Intrepid (CV 11)) with a classmate. The structure is similar to the Minsk aircraft carrier museum in Shenzhen. They are both decommissioned aircraft carriers, with some other aircraft on display.\nConcorde Aircraft on display on the aircraft carrier and Manhattan Island Before returning to the hotel in the evening, I also went for a walk in Grand Central, which mainly handles MTA subway and LIRR commuter rail traffic.\nGrand Central Another feature of New York is its steam system for heating. However, due to years of disrepair, you can often see steam coming out of cracked pipes on the street.\nUnderground steam system Day 10: New York United Nations Headquarters In the morning, I visited the United Nations. You need to book tickets in advance. One hour before the guided tour, you need to go to the Visitor Check-in Office opposite the UN headquarters to get a tag using your passport, and then you can enter the main building after security check.\nUnited Nations building and the US Mission to the United Nations opposite Non-Violence sculpture The guided tour lasts about an hour. If there are no meetings that day, the tour guide will take you to see several major meeting rooms.\nMeeting room of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) General Assembly Hall Metropolitan Museum of Art In the afternoon, I went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Since it was a bit late when I entered (only 1.5 hours before closing), we followed the “An Hour at The Met” guide on the Met’s official website and visited some famous exhibits. However, this website has been removed as of the time I write this blog, and I don’t know why. This guide page can be found in the web archive. Or you can check the museum’s official website for any tours on the day of your visit and make your arrangements accordingly.\nYellow taxis in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Temple of Dendur Charles Engelhard Court, mainly exhibiting classical European sculptures E 82nd St Central Park We stayed until the museum closed. After leaving the museum, I went to Central Park. The park itself wasn’t particularly special and was similar to many city parks in mainland China. Maybe the main point is that the park is built on the valuable land of Manhattan.\nA scene from Central Park It started to rain after walking near Columbus Circle, and we took shelter next to a tree for a while Columbus Circle, also the center of the geographical restrictions for G3 visa holders in the United States (restricting holders to only operate within a 25-mile radius of Columbus Circle) Central Park Tower Woolworth Building and the USPS below Day 11: New York-Washington, D.C. Because I wanted to experience another type of public transportation in North America, we chose to take the train from New York to Washington, D.C. There are three types of trains to choose from: Northeast Regional, Silver Meteor, and Acela. The Northeast Regional and Silver Meteor are regular speed trains that can travel at 200km/h, while Acela is a high-speed train that can travel at 250km/h. The price is also cheaper for the first two. If you don’t have a strict time requirement, you can consider purchasing the Northeast Regional. If booked 1-2 months in advance, tickets can be as low as 25 USD from New York to Washington, D.C., which is very cheap compared to other transportation methods like the subway.\nNY Penn Station, this station was renovated in 2023. Like in mainland China, the station only allows people to go down the elevator to the platform about 10 minutes before departure Northeast Regional train Northeast Regional train tickets do not assign seats; seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. Half of the seats in each car are in the reverse direction.\nSignage The windows in the car are relatively small, but the seats are very wide, about the width of a first-class seat on a high-speed train in mainland China. Each row of seats has charging plugs and other facilities After the train starts, the ticket inspector will come to check tickets (scan the QR code on the electronic ticket). After checking the tickets, the inspector will place a card above the seat (in the paper ticket era, they would directly insert the ticket above the seat), indicating that the seat has been checked and occupied.\nPassing a rail yard near Philadelphia Arriving at Washington Union Station. Interestingly, before arriving in Washington, the train attendant said that for security reasons, it was necessary to lock the train toilets in the district Union Station subway station Subway train, which looks newer than the ones in New York You need to swipe a SmartTrip card to enter the Washington subway. You can open a card in Apple Pay (with an opening fee) or buy one with a credit card at a self-service vending machine (you can load it into your phone after purchasing and get a commemorative card).\nSampannee, also a Thai restaurant, with quite large portions. We didn’t realize the size of the portions at first and ended up packing half of it back to eat later Day 12: White House, Washington Monument White House White House photographed from the north side White House photographed from the south side, with a Secret Service police car in the foreground Washington Monument You need to book tickets for the Washington Monument elevator and the museum at the top one month in advance. Visitors can book on the www.recreation.gov website, go in, select a time slot, and pay a 1 USD booking fee. If time is tight, there are also same-day tickets available at the foot of the monument every morning, but you might have to go quite early. To visit the monument, you need to go through security first (similar to airport security), and then take an elevator inside the monument to a museum at the top. The museum has some display boards introducing the construction and maintenance of the monument, and small windows where you can see the views around the monument.\nWashington Monument, the monument itself is blocking the sun Entrance to the monument East side, you can see the Capitol Northwest side, you can see the Ellipse and the White House North side, you can see the White House South side, you can see the Tidal Basin, and also planes taking off from DCA airport Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History mainly displays biological specimens and geological minerals. The collection is very rich, especially the minerals, where samples from almost all minerals you can find on the market are displayed.\nElephant specimen in the center of the Smithsonian Museum.

You need to book a tour on the website to enter. The tour starts with a guide showing a short video introducing the Capitol system. Then, the guide will take you around the hall. Meeting rooms seem to require a separate arrangement with a member of Congress to enter.\nCapitol Visitor Center The dome of the Capitol Building. Inside, sculptures donated by each state are on display. The guide said that these sculptures are often changed Dome of the Library of Congress Library of Congress Capitol Building restaurant, standard Western-style cafeteria East side of the Capitol Building West side of the Capitol Building, also where the presidential inauguration ceremony takes place. The flag was at half-staff that day, but I couldn’t find the specific reason (perhaps a member of Congress had passed away) National Gallery of Art Alexander Calder’s Monumental Mobile. The sculpture slowly rotates in the breeze from the air conditioning Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum has two locations, one in the city and one next to the IAD airport. The museum in the city is more educational, with more interactive exhibits, while the museum next to the airport is larger, with more aircraft models (including SR71, the space shuttle, etc.). Due to scheduling, I only went to the museum in the city.\nAircraft inside the museum A blue school bus Day 14: Return Trip My return journey was on United Airlines, flying from Washington Dulles IAD to San Francisco SFO, then taking a Singapore Airlines flight to Singapore SIN, and finally transferring back to Hong Kong HKG.

2024. In this two-week trip, I visited cities on the West Coast, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, and on the East Coast, including New York and Washington, D.C.</p><h2 id=route-and-attractions-map>Route and Attractions Map<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#route-and-attractions-map>#</a></h2><p>My general itinerary involved driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, then flying to New York, taking a train to Washington, D.C., and finally flying back to San Francisco.</p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1whktxjF_jX-ltkX6EGLhhOnm9aqN3dA&ehbc=2E312F" width=100% height=480></iframe><h2 id=pre-trip-preparations>Pre-Trip Preparations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pre-trip-preparations>#</a></h2><h3 id=visa>Visa<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#visa>#</a></h3><p>Fill out the DS-160 form, schedule an interview slot, and then go for an interview at the consulate. Slots at the southern consulates are quite tight, so it&rsquo;s advisable to book about <strong>a year</strong> in advance of your planned trip. Based on DPs from people around me, graduate students applying for a visa may be <strong>asked by the officer to provide a transcript and CV (even if the purpose is tourism)</strong>, so it&rsquo;s recommended to prepare these in advance. If you don&rsquo;t have them, you might be put on hold (check), and you&rsquo;ll need to send your transcript, CV, and travel plan to the consulate&rsquo;s email, which takes about a month to process. You&rsquo;ll then get a one-year visa with <code>CLEARANCE RECEIVED 202X-XX-XX</code>. It&rsquo;s said that this <a href=https://www.uscardforum.com/t/topic/151274/100>clearance is valid for 48 months</a>, but I haven&rsquo;t tried to get another visa yet. The only advantage of a one-year visa compared to a ten-year one is that you don&rsquo;t need to fill out EVUS again.</p><h3 id=flights>Flights<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#flights>#</a></h3><p>It&rsquo;s recommended to check Google Flights and other platforms frequently. Generally, it&rsquo;s advisable to start looking at and buying transoceanic flight tickets about 6 months before your trip, as prices are relatively lower then. However, since I chose to travel in August, which may coincide with many international students returning to school, the prices for direct flights and convenient connecting flights (via Japan and South Korea) all exceeded 10,000 RMB. After considering flight prices and comfort, I chose the route MFM-SIN-SFO and SFO-SIN-HKG, operated by Singapore Airlines, which cost about 7,500 RMB per person after a student discount. But it must be said that this route is much longer than a direct flight. The great-circle distance for the MFM-SIN-SFO one-way journey is as high as <a href="http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=MFM-SIN-SFO&amp;MS=wls&amp;DU=km">16,117km</a>, a distance that can reach South America. In comparison, the direct HKG-SFO flight is only <a href="http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=HKG-SFO&amp;DU=km">11,147km</a>, a difference of 1/3 in distance.</p><p>For domestic flights within the US, it&rsquo;s recommended to purchase tickets about 2 months before departure. However, considering that the three major US airlines (UA, DL, AA) allow free changes and refunds for the price difference (as vouchers) on domestic flights, even if you buy a more expensive ticket, you can convert it to a cheaper one through a refund as a voucher.</p><h3 id=car-rental>Car Rental<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#car-rental>#</a></h3><p>Considering that this was my first time driving overseas, we booked a car on the website 租租车 (Zuzuche) for our self-drive trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles. (In theory, large OTAs like Zuzuche and Ctrip should work, as they can get travel agency rates. The only requirement is that the renter needs to present a mainland China driver&rsquo;s license.) The car rental company we were assigned was Avis. Renting a Compact car for 7 days cost about 495 USD. The actual car we got was a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Elantra#Seventh_generation_%28CN7;_2020%29>2020 Hyundai Elantra Limited</a>, which had features like ACC, lane keeping, and CarPlay. Aside from the average noise control, I was quite satisfied with it.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_6363.avif alt="2020 Hyundai Elantra Limited"><figcaption>2020 Hyundai Elantra Limited</figcaption></figure></p><div class="callout callout-warning">Both mainland China and North America use left-hand drive and right-hand traffic. The main differences are that in North America, you need to completely stop for about 3 seconds at a STOP sign before proceeding, and when turning right at a red light, you also need to stop completely before turning. Another detail I noticed is that when waiting at a red light in North America, don&rsquo;t get too close to the car in front of you. If you follow the habit of mainland China, Americans might think you&rsquo;re going to rear-end them, and they might even move forward a bit if you&rsquo;re too close.</div><h3 id=attractionsexperience-ticket-bookings>Attractions/Experience Ticket Bookings<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#attractionsexperience-ticket-bookings>#</a></h3><p>Museums in the United States are not as competitive as those in Europe and other places. Generally, booking two or three days in advance or even buying tickets on-site is fine. The only tickets that were sold out on-site were the ferry tickets to Alcatraz Island in San Francisco.</p><div class="callout callout-info">I personally recommend using the website &ldquo;<a href=https://www.meilvtong.com/>美旅通</a>&rdquo; for planning, especially when specifying the itinerary for visiting major attractions. I think it works very well. Compared to Xiaohongshu and some &ldquo;travel blogs&rdquo;, its information density is high, and it has basically no ads (I feel its main source of revenue is from accommodation affiliate links).</div><h3 id=payment-methodstipping>Payment Methods/Tipping<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#payment-methodstipping>#</a></h3><div class="callout callout-info">If you don&rsquo;t want to rely on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu when choosing a restaurant, you can consider directly filtering restaurants on Google Maps with ratings higher than 4.3. Generally, restaurants above this line have some unique features and are not likely to be bad. Of course, if you&rsquo;re still too lazy to choose, you can consider eating at common chain fast-food restaurants like McDonald&rsquo;s, Wendy&rsquo;s, Taco Bell, etc.</div><p>Most places support credit card payments. We only encountered one small pizza place that didn&rsquo;t accept credit cards. Considering the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratuity>tipping culture</a> in North America (though I don&rsquo;t like it), it&rsquo;s recommended to have a few tens of 1 USD bills for tipping hotel shuttle drivers and housekeeping (if you don&rsquo;t have them, it&rsquo;s okay not to tip. I exchanged some at the hotel front desk on the first day).</p><table><thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Is Tipping Recommended?</th><th>How Much to Tip</th><th>How to Tip</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Handling luggage, valet parking</td><td>If no price is listed, yes</td><td>1 USD per bag, valet parking depends on the situation</td><td>Cash</td></tr><tr><td>Housekeeping</td><td>If staying more than 1 night, yes</td><td>2-5 USD per night</td><td>Cash, placed under the pillow</td></tr><tr><td>Restaurant (with waiter service)</td><td>Generally yes</td><td>If writing the tip amount, I usually give 10-15% of the <strong>pre-tax amount</strong> and round it up.</td><td>Calculated when paying by card</td></tr><tr><td>Restaurant (counter service)</td><td>Optional</td><td>If the server doesn&rsquo;t bring the food and I pick it up myself, I usually don&rsquo;t tip. If the server brings the food, then I give 10%</td><td>Calculated when paying by card. Some POS machines have default options like 15%, 18%, 20%. You can ignore them and enter your own custom amount.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=phonedata-card>Phone/Data Card<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#phonedata-card>#</a></h3><p>If you have a phone that supports eSIM, you can try the 15-day <a href=https://www.uscardforum.com/t/topic/238582>trial</a> with Visible or Verizon. Or you can buy a phone card on Fliggy (飞猪). A 15-day card costs around 120-150 CNY. It&rsquo;s important to note that if you&rsquo;re driving in more remote areas, most carriers might not have signal (like in the middle of Highway 1). If necessary, you can download offline maps. Also, hotspotting on American phone cards will be speed-limited (about 5Mbps). If you need higher speeds, it&rsquo;s better for everyone to have their own card.</p><h3 id=climate>Climate<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#climate>#</a></h3><p>The weather on both the East and West Coasts in August isn&rsquo;t too cold, with temperatures ranging between 15-30 degrees Celsius. The coldest times (San Francisco mornings, New York) require a sweater and a jacket, while the hottest times (Los Angeles) are fine with a t-shirt and shorts.</p><h2 id=day-0-arrival-in-san-francisco>Day 0: Arrival in San Francisco<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-0-arrival-in-san-francisco>#</a></h2><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5484.avif alt="Sunset seen from the Macau-Singapore leg, very vibrant"><figcaption>Sunset seen from the Macau-Singapore leg, very vibrant</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5568.avif alt="Sunrise on the plane, this should be near Alaska"><figcaption>Sunrise on the plane, this should be near Alaska</figcaption></figure></p><p>Considering the need to pick up our rental car on the third day and the price of accommodation in the city center, we chose to stay at the <a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/EfXQa4RdKSzqmpjX7>Aloft SFO</a> hotel in the Millbrae area near the airport. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to and from the airport, about every half hour, and it takes 10 minutes on the shuttle. The Millbrae station of the Caltrain and BART is also close to the hotel, about a 10-minute walk away.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5590.avif alt="San Francisco Airport International Terminal, you can wait here for the free shuttle to the hotel"><figcaption>San Francisco Airport International Terminal, you can wait here for the free shuttle to the hotel</figcaption></figure></p><p>After dropping off our luggage, a local friend took me around the city, briefly visiting areas near Union Square and Chinatown.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5598.avif alt="View of I80 heading into the city and part of the San Francisco skyline"><figcaption>View of I80 heading into the city and part of the San Francisco skyline</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5609.avif alt="A street scene near Chinatown"><figcaption>A street scene near Chinatown</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5613.avif alt="A &ldquo;hollowed-out&rdquo; city center, with many shops vacant and &ldquo;For Lease&rdquo; signs posted"><figcaption>A &ldquo;hollowed-out&rdquo; city center, with many shops vacant and &ldquo;For Lease&rdquo; signs posted</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5615.avif alt="Area near Union Square, with a Waymo RoboTaxi and the Apple Store in the distance"><figcaption>Area near Union Square, with a Waymo RoboTaxi and the Apple Store in the distance</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5621.avif alt="Road near Millbrae, looks new, probably recently built"><figcaption>Road near Millbrae, looks new, probably recently built</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id=day-1-san-francisco-city>Day 1: San Francisco City<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-san-francisco-city>#</a></h2><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://img.meilvtong.com/dataHouse2/US//month_2_2402/240209222177b1a8f3815339a7.png alt="Map from &ldquo;美旅通&rdquo;"><figcaption>Map from &ldquo;美旅通&rdquo;</figcaption></figure></p><p>Considering San Francisco&rsquo;s safety issues (especially <a href=https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/car-break-ins-san-francisco-2/3667342/>car break-ins</a>), we didn&rsquo;t try to drive in the city center. Instead, we mainly relied on public transportation like BART, trams, and buses.</p><p>In the morning, I took the BART into the city. You can use Clipper to ride BART, which can be opened on an iPhone (no opening fee). It must be said that the <a href=https://sfstandard.com/2024/09/18/bart-evading-fares-new-gates/>fare evasion issue</a> on BART is serious. Both when entering and exiting the station, I saw more than one person jumping over the ticket barriers, and the staff didn&rsquo;t seem to care much.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5627.avif alt="BART interior, a special feature is that BART is a wide-gauge train, so the interior looks a bit wider than regular subways"><figcaption>BART interior, a special feature is that BART is a wide-gauge train, so the interior looks a bit wider than regular subways</figcaption></figure></p><p>After getting to Union Square, we walked to the Painted Ladies and then to Japantown, where we had lunch.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5642.avif alt="Painted Ladies and city skyline"><figcaption>Painted Ladies and city skyline</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_5662.avif alt="Peace Pagoda in Japantown"><figcaption>Peace Pagoda in Japantown</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_1099.avif alt="Ramen in Japantown (HINODEYA Ramen Japantown)"><figcaption>Ramen in Japantown (HINODEYA Ramen Japantown)</figcaption></figure></p><p>After lunch, we experienced <a href=https://waymo.com/>Waymo</a>&rsquo;s self-driving car.

However, this website has been removed as of the time I write this blog, and I don&rsquo;t know why. This guide page can be found in the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20240421061933/https://www.metmuseum.org/itineraries/highlights/>web archive</a>. Or you can check the museum&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.metmuseum.org/tours>official website</a> for any tours on the day of your visit and make your arrangements accordingly.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_7229.avif alt="Yellow taxis in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art"><figcaption>Yellow taxis in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_7234.avif alt="The Temple of Dendur"><figcaption>The Temple of Dendur</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_7239.avif alt="Charles Engelhard Court, mainly exhibiting classical European sculptures"><figcaption>Charles Engelhard Court, mainly exhibiting classical European sculptures</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_7267.jpg alt="E 82nd St"><figcaption>E 82nd St</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=central-park>Central Park<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#central-park>#</a></h3><p>We stayed until the museum closed.

There are three types of trains to choose from: Northeast Regional, Silver Meteor, and Acela. The Northeast Regional and Silver Meteor are regular speed trains that can travel at 200km/h, while Acela is a high-speed train that can travel at 250km/h. The price is also cheaper for the first two. If you don&rsquo;t have a strict time requirement, you can consider purchasing the Northeast Regional. If booked 1-2 months in advance, tickets can be as low as 25 USD from New York to Washington, D.C., which is very cheap compared to other transportation methods like the subway.</p><p><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.sparktour.me/img/blog/2024/2024-summer-usa-travel-notes/IMG_7331.avif alt="NY Penn Station, this station was renovated in 2023.
